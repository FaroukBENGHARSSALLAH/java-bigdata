Spark MLlib is a distributed machine learning framework on top of Spark Core that, due in large part to the distributed memory-based Spark architecture, is as much as nine times as fast as the disk-based implementation used by Apache Mahout (according to benchmarks done by the MLlib developers against the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) implementations, and before Mahout itself gained a Spark interface), and scales better than Vowpal Wabbit. Many common machine learning and statistical algorithms have been implemented and are shipped with MLlib which simplifies large scale machine learning pipelines, including:

* summary statistics : correlations, stratified sampling, hypothesis testing, random data generation
* classification and regression : support vector machines, logistic regression, linear regression, decision trees, naive Bayes classification
* collaborative filtering : including alternating least squares (ALS)
* cluster analysis methods : including k-means, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
* dimensionality reduction :  such as singular value decomposition (SVD), and principal component analysis (PCA)
* feature extraction and transformation functions
* optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent, limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS)
	
These projects are being currently developed
